A week or so ago I released a [web app](http://truebpm.dance/) that helps break down the distribution of BPM durations in DDR charts.

With 735 songs in DDR A as of this writing, it can be daunting to pick ones that you've never played before, especially since there are more than a handful with unreported BPM changes.

The tool aims to assist with that by listing BPMs defined in the chart, from longest duration to shortest:

As of now, all packs in the arcade section at [Zenius -I- vanisher](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/simfiles.php?category=simfiles) are represented, minus Dancing Stage, Internet Ranking, and Solo.

Feel free to try it out and [report bugs!](https://github.com/zachwalton/truebpm/issues/new)
